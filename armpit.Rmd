I had a hunch that armpits were stinkier on the same side as the dominant hand. This is what I found.

## Participants

The initial sample was 987 people, r/SampleSize subreddit users and my Facebook friends. 48% identified as female, 48% identified as male, 1% preferred not to say, and 2% self-described (with most describing themselves as "Agender"). 86% were right-handed, 11% were left-handed, 3% were ambidextrous.

A surprising amount (63%) said both armpits smelled the same or weren't sure. (These weren't included in my analysis because my hunch was about armpit smell asymmetry.)

## Other Notes

* Handedness did not change the proportion of people who armpits "smelled about the same" or were "not sure". The proportion also held for ambidextrous people, though interestingly, they had smellier *right* armpits at about a 9:1 ratio.
* Gender did not change the proportion of stinky armpits on dominant vs non-dominant side.
* 11% of the sample were lefties, which roughly matches the 10% found in the population.
* Only 15 respondents were ambidextrous, 3% of the initial sample. 

## Limitations

* I should have asked which armpit is smellier **without deodorant**. I wonder how much of "about the same" responses were due to the masking effect of deodorant.
* There should have been a response option for "No smell", which apparently 2% of the population has (https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-lucky-two-percent-of-people-have-a-gene-for-stink-free-armpits-2508106). If that rate holds for the sample, that would have been  about 20 respondents. Practically though, this issue does not affect the primary analysis, which only examined armpit stinkiness asymmetry.

## Open-ended Feedback

I asked, "Do you have any feedback about the survey?" Here are some notable responses and my reply, if any.

```{r show feedback, echo=F}
options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
df %>%
  filter(feedback_show==1) %>%
  select(c(feedback, feedback_fred)) %>%
  rename(Feedback=feedback,
         `Reply from Fred`=feedback_fred) %>%
  kable(format="html") 
```



## Tools
I used R for analyses and Google Sheets and Photoshop for data visualization.
