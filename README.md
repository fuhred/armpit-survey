Armpit Survey Results
================
7/29/2019

I had a hunch that armpits were stinkier on the same side as the
dominant hand. This is what I found.

## Participants

The initial sample was 987 people, r/SampleSize subreddit users and my
Facebook friends. 48% identified as female, 48% identified as male, 1%
preferred not to say, and 2% self-described (with most describing
themselves as “Agender”). 86% were right-handed, 11% were left-handed,
3% were ambidextrous.

A surprising amount (63%) said both armpits smelled the same or weren’t
sure. (These weren’t included in my analysis because my hunch was about
armpit smell asymmetry.)

## Other Notes

  - Handedness did not change the proportion of people who armpits
    “smelled about the same” or were “not sure”. The proportion also
    held for ambidextrous people, though interestingly, they had
    smellier *right* armpits at about a 9:1 ratio.
  - Gender did not change the proportion of stinky armpits on dominant
    vs non-dominant side.
  - 11% of the sample were lefties, which roughly matches the 10% found
    in the population.
  - Only 15 respondents were ambidextrous, 3% of the initial sample.

## Limitations

  - I should have asked which armpit is smellier **without deodorant**.
    I wonder how much of “about the same” responses were due to the
    masking effect of deodorant.
  - There should have been a response option for “No smell”, which
    apparently 2% of the population has
    (<https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-lucky-two-percent-of-people-have-a-gene-for-stink-free-armpits-2508106>).
    If that rate holds for the sample, that would have been about 20
    respondents. Practically though, this issue does not affect the
    primary analysis, which only examined armpit stinkiness asymmetry.

As someone who works outdoors a lot through the summer, my pits smell
the same. When I sweat, it’s all over, not one out vs the other. I think
you should ask paraplegics who only have 1 arm this question.

I think I see where you’re going with this, the armpit of the dominant
hand will be stinkier. However, I have noticed that on the very rare
occasion my pits stink ;) they both smell equally bad.

It might be relevant to ask about when people last put on deodorant.
Small differences not long after applying deodorant may make people
think the smell is equal.
